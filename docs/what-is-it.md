# What is it ?

**Own Your Stack** is a practical guide for building robust infrastructure without being locked into a specific Cloud Provider's services. By implementing the guidance in *Own Your Stack*, you will be able to construct a reliable, cost-effective, and **independent** infrastructure.

*Own Your Stack* is designed to empower companies with the freedom to determine and manage their own IT infrastructure. Grounded in Open Source Software, *Own Your Stack* offers alternative software options beyond traditional Cloud Provider services, enabling you to build your company's IT infrastructure. While we acknowledge the excellent quality of services provided by Cloud Providers like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), which are battle-tested and fully supported, these benefits do not come for free. There is a significant cost involved, including high expenses and dependency on the provider.

The high costs imply that you must prepare a substantial budget. This may not significantly impact large, global-scale companies. However, there are millions of small to medium-sized businesses for which price sensitivity is a critical concern. Armed with the guidance from *Own Your Stack*, these businesses can still develop a robust IT infrastructure based on Open Source Software.

Likewise, dependency on a provider might not pose a serious issue for some types of companies. However, if you value the freedom to switch Cloud Providers, implement hybrid clouds, and so on, it is worth seriously considering breaking free from such dependencies. *Own Your Stack* offers you the freedom to migrate from one Cloud Provider to another for various reasons. Perhaps you are dissatisfied with a provider's service, have found a more cost-effective option, or your company has policies that necessitate migration for specific reasons. Migrating to another provider can be a painful nightmare if you are heavily tied to a particular one. For example, if your application uses [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) from AWS, imagine the significant effort required to migrate to GCP. You might choose to continue subscribing to DynamoDB even after moving your application from AWS. Alternatively, you and your team might face the daunting task of rewriting the application to break free from the shackles of such dependencies.

Choosing *Own Your Stack* for your infrastructure is not without its drawbacks. The most apparent negative impact is the substantial effort required to maintain your IT infrastructure. You will need adequate knowledge and skills to manage your infrastructure independently. However, based on our experience, we see this as an advantage. Understanding the intricacies of your IT infrastructure that supports your company's business can be invaluable.

So, what's your choice?
